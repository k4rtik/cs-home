I don't really recall why I avoided Java all this while.

Few weeks after arriving here at Brown, I learnt Brown is, what they call, a Java school. That's probably not completely true, but for a [vast majority](http://cs.brown.edu/news/2015/09/30/brown-cs-introductory-course-enrollment-sets-records/) of students that take Andy's intro class, [CS15](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/), it is. I have come to realize it is not such a bad thing (quite the opposite).

I remember my first few weeks at [college](http://nitc.ac.in) when I was trying to teach myself Java in the [CC](http://ccc.nitc.ac.in/) (whoa, they have a website now!). I had struggled to download the latest edition of Java (with NetBeans IDE) and had it installed on one of the systems with the help of CC staff admin. Then, somewhere down the line, the focus was switched to learning HTML & CSS properly as I took up the challenge of building a [new website for the CSE department](http://cse.nitc.ac.in).

As I look back, NITC was a C school. Our intro course was taught by a faculty member from Civil department and, yes, we were supposed to code in [Turbo C++ IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B). I knew better at the time and was using GCC on Linux. What I did not know about though was STL and why it was important that I learnt it as soon as I could. Course assignments and labs, over the next two years including Data Structures, Compilers, Networks, Operating Systems were all done in C. One exception was the lab on Programming Languages which was done using OCaml, but there wasn't enough of it with just 4 visits to the lab in one whole semester. In the final year, when a lot of students did projects with higher level languages like Java or C++, I chose to work on GCC (C again). Next two years of life were spent getting a sense of and maintaining a a part of a huge C codebase for a large and fairly old company. Long story short, I had become *just* a C programmer, whether I liked it or not.

Well, not quite, there were certainly smaller adventures played out with Python and couple more attempts to learn Java (some _Head First Java_ during summer of '12; the remote internship for which I actually wrote some production Java code; and, a little bit of [Androidy-Java about a year ago](http://techglider.in/quote/2015/03/05/live-as-if-you-were-to-die-tomorrow-learn/)). But shorter stints are not enough to learn a language. Moreover, anyone who does Java/C++ can tell you what a pain it is to use C which lacks containers and algorithms in its standard library. In my own experience, it is always dreadful to think about implementing your own data structures each time you work on a non-trivial program. Further, it prevented me from thinking at a higher abstraction level when it came to solving problems (lost in detail, as they say).

As it turns out, I am going to TA CS32 in the next semester, which is a Java class and I wanted to prepare myself for the same. This is what I am doing in the break:
